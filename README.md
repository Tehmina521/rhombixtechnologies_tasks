## 🧾 Conclusion & Insights

-  Gender was the most influential factor — females had a much higher survival rate.

- Passenger Class (Pclass) strongly affected survival — 1st class passengers were more likely to survive.

- Age and Family Size also influenced survival probabilities.

- Fare indicated socio-economic status — higher fares correlated with better survival odds.

- The Random Forest model achieved around 80–85% accuracy.

✅ This project demonstrates how data-driven analysis and machine learning can uncover patterns behind survival outcomes.
